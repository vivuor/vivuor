## Hi, I'm Ville Vuoremaa

I'm an IT student at Haaga-Helia. I enjoy creating things. Here you can find some of those.

After working multiple years that didn't have any link to my previous studies, I wanted to start a new journey. I have always enjoyed working with computers and all kinds of tech. That's why starting Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia seemed like a logical choice.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, UI and UX design.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, Python and React Native.
